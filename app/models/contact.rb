# A {Contact} is an ordered pair of {Actor Actors},
# and therefore two {SocialStream::Models::Subject Subjects}.
#
# {Contact Contacts} are created at convenience (in the case of {Actor#suggestions suggestions},
# for instance), and they do not mean that there is a real link between those two
# {SocialStream::Models::Subject Subjects}. Link existance is stored as {Tie Ties}.
#
# = {Contact Contacts} and {Activity activities}
#
# WARNING: This will be change soon to direct references to author, owner and user_author,
# in the same way as {ActivityObject}
#
# Each {Activity} is attached to a {Contact}. When _Alice_ post in _Bob_'s wall,
# the {Activity} is attached to the {Contact} from _Alice_ to _Bob_
#
# * The sender of the {Contact} is the author of the {Activity}.
#   It is the user that uploads a resource to the website or the social entity that
#   originates the {Activity} (for example: add as contact).
#
# * The receiver {Actor} of the {Contact} is the receiver of the {Activity}.
#   The {Activity} will appear in the wall of the receiver, depending on the permissions
