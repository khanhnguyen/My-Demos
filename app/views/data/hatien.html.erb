            Ha Tien is a seaside town in Kien Giang Province in Southern Vietnam. It is at the western end of the Mekong Delta close to the Cambodian border. Although a tourist spot it hasn't yet seen many western visitors due to its remoteness. As a result the English literacy of even the hotel staff is next to nothing. However, the opening of the border to Cambodia for international travelers recently is likely to change that in the near future.

            <b>Get in</b>
            <br/>
            The bus terminal is west of the city center (it was moved there from To Chau on the other side of the bay around January 2008). There are buses from Ho Chi Minh City's Mien Tay terminal (about 8h) as well as from Can Tho and Chau Doc. The connection from Can Tho often requires a change in Rach Soi or Rach Gia from where it is about 1h.
            The border near Ha Tien (7km to the north) was opened for tourists in 2007. It takes around 2h to go to Kampot by motorbike. As of April 2008, there were no buses connecting Ha Tien to Kampot. Some of the roads in Cambodia on the way to Kampot are not paved, but you will be able to see some nice rural areas there.
            From Kampot you can get a motobike taxi for $9-10 or from Kep for $7 to the border on the Cambodian side. The road can vary in condition from paved and bumpy to packed dirt and bumpy, be prepared for a slightly white knuckled ride depending on the daring nature of your driver. Also, be aware that there seem to be Vietnamese drivers now waiting well inside the Cambodian side waiting to pickup (poach) prospective travelers to take them across the border into town. Your driver may stop here to talk with them and seem to suggest you go with them. A ride to town should be $3-4 or less (it is only 7 km and the road is well paved on the Vietnamese side.) If you can't agree on a price there you can simply have your Cambodian driver take you to the border where you can cross over and have the drivers on the other side fight over you.
            <br/>
            <b>Get around</b>
            <br/>
            The centre of town is easily walkable with Tran Hau the main commercial street running along the seaside between the big bridge for road traffic (Cau To Chau) and the former pontoon bridge for pedestrians (Cau Phao, removed in early 2007).
            <br/>
            <b>See</b>
            <br/>
            Try to get one of the tourist maps where the location of the temples are indicated. 
            <br/>
            * Chua Tam Bao is probably the best of the temples. 
            <br/>
            * Chua Giai Thoat 
            <br/>
            * Tinh Xa Ngoc Ho 
            <br/>
            <b>Do</b>
            <br/>
            * A nice and easy bicycle ride can be done by first going to Mui Nai then continuing along the Cambodian border until finally ending up in Ha Tien again. On the way there's a barrel-shaped hill with a temple inside (entrance: 2000 dong). 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b>Eat </b>
            <br/>
            * There's a cheap and delicious eatery (around 20,000 dong/dish) on 47 Mach Thien Tich half way between Chi Lang and Mach Cuu. Look for the two woks on the sidewalk. An English menu is available. Try the stir fried squid with cucumber. Dinner only. 
            <br/>
            * Along the waterway on Tran Hau there are numerous open air eateries serving various fresh seafood every night. Squid, snails, and other seafood/shellfish available here. 
            <br/>
            * Pho 66 is a recommended Pho place on the east side of town on To Chau just south of Chi Lang. 
            <br/>
            <b>Drink</b>
            <br/>
            Fresh coconut juice with toddy palm, Vietnamese French coffee
            <br/>
            <b>Sleep</b>
            <br/>
            There is no shortage of options for accommodation in this town. It seems that every other building is either a Kach San (hotel) or a Phong Tro (a place that has rooms to rent). The epicentre of sleeping options can be considered the area delimited by Tran Hau, Mach Thien Tich and Chi Lang streets. 
            <br/>
            * Viet Toan, 74 Chi Lang, is one of the best budget places. The staff is very friendly and one of them even speaks some English. The rooms are decent and come with TV (lucky if you get anything in English though), fridge, private bathroom and fan or aircon. From 80,000 dong for a fan room. 
            <br/>
            * Hai Yen, 15 To Chau, has probably the best rooms in town for the price. The superior rooms (200,000 dong) are huge, have balcony and a good view onto Dam Dong Ho (the bay). From 150,000 dong.
